## Project Overview
The goal of this project was for our team to analyze data on job postings for two roles within the healthcare vertical and examine what drove job-seeker demand for those roles within the US economy. Ultimately, we wanted to make recommendations to Greenwich, our customer, about how they might sell consulting to other companies using that data, and how to monetize whatever we discovered through our analysis. In the course of this project, we conducted Exploratory Data Analysis, and then pursued a variety of analytical approaches based on that initial exploration. In the end, we identified useful trends relating time to fill a position with the specific tags and variables that were associated with a position, whether it was in an urban or rural area and what region of the country it was in. Lastly, we built a logistic model for predicting whether a particular position would be filled within an acceptable period of time (defined as 30 days or less).
